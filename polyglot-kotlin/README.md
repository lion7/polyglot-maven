# Polyglot Kotlin  

## Overview

- Supports adhoc task execution via Kotlin lambdas and external scripts.
- Supports the complete Maven model.
- Preserves well-known Maven idioms with a Kotlin flavor, allowing easy adoption.
- Supports Xpp3DOM (XML) configuration using idiomatic Kotlin.
- Provides idiomatic Kotlin extensions that improve readability and reduce lines of code.

## Kotlin POM Example

```kotlin
project("Polyglot :: Kotlin") {

    parent("io.takari.polyglot:polyglot:0.2.2-SNAPSHOT").relativePath("../pom.kts")

    id("com.example:my-project:1.0:jar")

    val junitVersion = 4.12

    properties {
        "maven.compiler.source" to 1.8
        "maven.compiler.target" to 1.8
        "kotlin.version" to "1.3.31"
    }

    dependencies {
        fun get(key: Any) = this@project.properties?.get(key)?.toString() ?: ""

        compile("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:" + get("kotlin.version"))
        compile("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-runtime:" + get("kotlin.version"))

        runtime(groupId = "io.takari", artifactId = "polyglot-common", version = this@project.version)
                .excluding("org.slf4j:jul-logger")

        test("junit:junit:$junitVersion").excluding("org.hamcrest:hamcrest-core")

        provided {
            groupId = "org.apache.maven.plugin-tools"
            artifactId = "maven-plugin-annotations"
            version = "3.4"
        }
    }

    build {
        finalName("\${project.artifactId}")

        sourceDirectory("src/main/kotlin")
        testSourceDirectory("src/test/kotlin")

        plugins {
            plugin(":maven-jar-plugin") {
                configuration {
                    "archive" {
                        "index" to true
                        "manifest" {
                            "addClasspath" to true
                            "mainClass" to "org.test.Main"
                        }
                        "manifestEntries" {
                            "mode" to "development"
                            "url"  to "\${project.url}"
                            "key"  to "value"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Embedded execute task
        execute(id = "hello", phase = "initialize") {
            log.info("Hello from ${project.name}")
        }

        // External execute task script
        execute(id = "hello-script", phase = "process-resources", script = "src/build/kotlin/hello.kts")
    }
}
```

## IDE support

Any IDE that supports loading Maven extensions should be able to resolve the Maven model. Currently,
only IntelliJ IDEA seems to do this.

## Known Issues

- Each Kotlin `ScriptEngine` requires a classpath that includes information from Maven's own classpath as well as the
  extension's `ClassRealm` (which is a special type of `ClassLoader`). This classpath is used to create an additional
  `ClassLoader` for use by the `ScriptEngine` which requires the Maven process to consume more metaspace memory than it
  would if the Kotlin `ScriptEngine` were able to obtain the class information it needs from the existing classloader.
  This is a limitation of the Kotlin script engine. (See [KT-27956](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-27956))

  While this issue does not appear to have a significant impact on Maven's command-line performance, it does affect the
  performance of IntelliJ IDEA's remote Maven server process (as of Build #IU_183.5912.21). The IDE's remote Maven
  server appears to create a new `ClassRealm` every time it reimports the Maven model. This in turn causes a new
  `ScriptEngine` with its additional `ClassLoader` to be re-created even though these are created as singletons. This
  results in the IDE's Maven server process consuming much more metaspace over time than it would otherwise, especially
  for multi-module projects.

  If you care about this issue, please vote for [KT-27956](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-27956) under the
  Kotlin project so that the Kotlin script engine can get the information it needs from the existing classloader.

- IntelliJ IDEA does not appear to auto-matically detect changes to `pom.kts`. The workaround is to manually reimport
  the Maven project.
